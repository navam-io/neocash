Review the NeoCash project. Review the /Users/manavsehgal/Developer/openvolo/ project for multi-agent automation cards and agent run interface. 

Brainstorm with me:

1. assess the current agent and tool use capabilities of NeoCash
2. what are the use cases for multi-agent capabilities for NeoCash
3. how would you implement these and what will the user experience look like
4. how will you seamlessly integrate NeoCash features like signals, actions, insights, goals, dashboard schema, conversations, etc.
5. review the Claude AI chat interface in the browser using reasoning, deep thinking capabilities. Note the thinking and tool user interface. How Claude AI informs the user while thinking, reasoning, using tools.
6. what will be the design changes, architecture changes, interface changes?

Do not retro-fit multi-agents. Think about product taste, user personas, model capabilities, compelling use cases, and future proofing NeoCash as model capabilities improve over time.
